Sprints are one week long.  Each Sprint will have a subpage in the KitsapTraining Wiki.  All blogs for that week's sprint will be subpages of the sprint page (like this one).  Anyone can make a wiki page, so if you are moved to write a blog and practice your markdown skillz, that would be nice.

Daily Routine for everyone (week days anyway)

- check KitsapTraining at dev.azure.com and read the blogs (find the wiki, blue icon) and
follow up on any tickets (green icon).  There are no tickets yet -- I'll write a blog when there are!
